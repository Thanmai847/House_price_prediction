# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts house prices based on property features using **Linear Regression**.  
It demonstrates the full machine learning workflow — from **data preprocessing** to **model evaluation** — including visualizations and a ready-to-use saved model.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- `Avg. Area Income` – Average income of residents in the area
- `Avg. Area Number of Rooms` – Average number of rooms per house
- `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms` – Average number of bedrooms per house
- `Price` – Target variable (house selling price)
